# What is HAProxy?

HAProxy is the fastest and most widely used open-source load balancer and application delivery controller. Written in C, it has a reputation for efficient use of both processor and memory. It can proxy at either layer 4 (TCP) or layer 7 (HTTP) and has additional features for inspecting, routing and modifying HTTP messages.

It comes bundled with a web UI, called the HAProxy Stats page, that you can use to monitor error rates, the volume of traffic and latency. Features can be toggled on by updating a single configuration file, which provides a syntax for defining routing rules, rate limiting, access controls, and more.

Other features include:

* SSL/TLS termination
* Gzip compression
* Health checking
* HTTP/2
* gRPC support
* Lua scripting
* DNS service discovery
* Automatic retries of failed conenctions
* Verbose logging

# How to use this image

This image is being shipped with a trivial sample configuration and for any real life use it should be configured according to the [extensive documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/) and [examples](https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/tree/master/examples). We will now show how to override shipped haproxy.cfg with one of your own.

## Create a `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM haproxytech/haproxy-ubuntu:2.0
COPY haproxy.cfg /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

## Build the container

```console
$ docker build -t my-haproxy .
```

## Test the configuration file

```console
$ docker run -it --rm my-haproxy haproxy -c -f /usr/local/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

## Run the container

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy my-haproxy
```

You will also need to publish the ports your HAProxy is listening on to the host by specifying the `-p` option, for example `-p 8080:80` to publish port 8080 from the container host to port 80 in the container.

## Directly via bind mount

```console
$ docker run -d --name my-running-haproxy -v /path/to/etc/haproxy:/usr/local/etc/haproxy:ro haproxytech/haproxy-ubuntu:2.0
```

Note that your host's `/path/to/etc/haproxy` folder should be populated with a file named `haproxy.cfg` as well as any other accompanying files local to `/etc/haproxy`.

### Reloading config

To be able to reload HAProxy configuration, you can send `SIGHUP` to the container:

```console
$ docker kill -s HUP my-running-haproxy
```

To achieve seamless reloads it is required to use `expose-fd listeners` and socket transfers which are not enabled by default. More on this topic is in the blog post [Truly Seamless Reloads with HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/truly-seamless-reloads-with-haproxy-no-more-hacks/).
